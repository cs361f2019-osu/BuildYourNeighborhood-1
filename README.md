# BuildYourNeighborhood
Build You Neighborhood is a Serious/Education Video Game developed by a team of 5: April James, Jacob Lagmay, Nathan Raymon, Lindy Voss, and Garrett Whitehurst
The point of this project is to showcase an ecological, man-made landmass called the bioswale. If you're not familiar with what a bioswale is, it is basically something that is installed inbetween a road and something like a sidewalk or a parking. It soaks up the water from the raod and filters it through its mulch and soil to deliver clean water into the community's water supply.

We convey the importance of the bioswale through gameplay. The player will take a block from a list of 4 blocks that is clearly displayed and pick a spot on a 5x5 grid to put that block. A score will be determined based on blocks in a surrounding area. In addition, there are 3 goals that are tied to the score, but will be shown independently so that the player can see how blocks can interact with each and affect the neighborhood they are building.

# Technology
We chose to build the game on the Unity Engine. Based on my prior experience with Unity, the ability to easily build an application for almost any platform, and its reliance on being a lighweight application made Unity an easy decision. Unreal Engine was another consideration we made, but none of us had any experience and it seemed to not be as flexible on building for different platforms and was generally more heavyweight on the device playing the game.

# The Work I have Done
The contributions I made to this project was a majority of the scripting/programming done to create the gameplay, and interaction between the player and UI designed by Jacob, as well as importing the 3D models into the game engine made by April and Jacob.
